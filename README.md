## What is PPI?

The [PPI Framework][@website] is a micro to light full-stack web framework. It
focuses on having a light footprint, convenient and minimalistic. It allows
developers to rapidly develop web applications and utilize features from 3rd
party libraries without the tedious integration of them into your project. It
also allows developers to build better and easy to maintain websites/web
applications.

### Why is PPI different?

PPI is not another framework to re-invent the wheel. The idea behind it is to
build a more pragmatic, simplistic and easier version of the wheel. It's built
re-using the core components of other web frameworks such as Symfony2, Doctrine2
and ZendFramework2.

PPI pre-integrates third libraries for you (aka autoloading) so that you can
drop their components into your Vendor folder and you're up and running
instantly. From PPI you're able to seamlessly have plug and play, moreso play
because that's the fun part!

PPI doesn't just stop at the PHP side of things, the skeleton application comes
pre-bundled with the latest and greatest trending libraries for frontend
development such as [HTML5 Boilerplate][@h5bp] and [Twitter
Bootstrap][@twbootstrap].
